<h1>Python & Scratch</h1>
<h2>Smilarities</h2>
<p>The programming logics in both Python and Scratch are the same. Both of them have Core 4. </p>
<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>Scratch is easier and faster for me to use since the characteristics of it being designed for children. Python is much more complicated to me and I haven't adapted to it yet.</p>
<h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>the process of debugging is frustating espeicially when I work so hard looking through every step of the code over and over again but still can not find out the problem. Most of the time, it is just a little detail that I ignore. In this case, I learned that small destils can be pivotal to the entire program.</p>
